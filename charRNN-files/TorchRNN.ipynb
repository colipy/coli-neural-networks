If you are unfamiliar with character-level RNNs, check out [this great article](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) by Andrej Karpathy. The network will train character by character on some text, then generate new text character by character. As an example, I will train on Anna Karenina, one of my favorite novels. I call this project Anna KaRNNa."
